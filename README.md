# Week-9-Honeypot-Assignment

### Which Honeypot(s) did you deployed?
I was able to configure both VMs on my google cloud platform but unfortunately, I have not been able to deploy my Honeypot. When installing the MHN admin application on the remote VM, I can not get bypassed this error that prevents me from installing the Honeypot application onto the Honeypot VM.

Therefore, I currently have both VMs up and running and are accessible through their external IPs but there is no Honeypot application (Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP) installed on the virtual machine. 

### Any issues you encountered?
Yes and in specific, installing the MHN Admin application on the remote machine. I was able to clone the github repository given in the instructions but when running the install script, it will prompt me halfway through the installation to enter a github username and password. After many trials, I was not able to get bypass this error and avoiding me to install the application which allow access to the MHN Admin console via the browser.
