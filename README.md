# Week-9-Honeypot-Assignment

### Which Honeypot(s) did you deployed?
I was able to configure both VMs on my google cloud platform but unfortunately, I have not been able to deploy my Honeypot. When installing the MHN admin application on the remote VM, I can not get bypassed this error that prevents me from installing the Honeypot application onto the Honeypot VM.

Therefore, I currently have both VMs up and running and are accessible through their external IPs but there is no Honeypot application (Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP) installed on the virtual machine.
